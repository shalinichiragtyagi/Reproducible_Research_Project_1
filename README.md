# Reproducible_Research_Project_1
## load the dataDataset: Activity monitoring data 

steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as 𝙽𝙰)
date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of 17,568 observations in this dataset.
## Transform the data
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

###For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

*1 Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them.
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
* What is the average daily activity pattern?

*3 Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps ta
ken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
*4Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
## Imputing missing values

*1 Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with 𝙽𝙰s)
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not
need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.
*2Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.
*3 Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median 
total number of steps taken per day. Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
*4 What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?
##  Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


* Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether 
a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis)
and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
